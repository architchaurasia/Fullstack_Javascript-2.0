        // Q.25 Body mass index(BMI) is calculated as follows: bmi = weight in Kg / (height x height) in m2. Write a function which calculates bmi. BMI is used to broadly define different weight groups in adults 20 years old or older.Check if a person is underweight, normal, overweight or obese based the information given below.
    // - The same groups apply to both men and women.
    // - Underweight: BMI is less than 18.5
    // - Normal weight: BMI is 18.5 to 24.9
    // - Overweight: BMI is 25 to 29.9
    // - Obese: BMI is 30 or more

    //Variable Declaration
    let height = prompt("Please enter your height")
    let weight = prompt("Please enter your weight")

    let bmi = weight/ (height**2);

    if(bmi < 18.5){
        alert("You are Underweight")
    }
    else if(bmi > 18.5 && bmi <= 24.9){
        alert("You are Normal weight")
    }
    else if(bmi > 25 && bmi <= 29.9){
        alert("You are Overweight")
    }
    else{
        alert("You are Obese")
